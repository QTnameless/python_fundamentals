# **Python** 🐍

> ### ***Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented and high-level programming language.***

### **Some advantages of learning Python** 👍

* **Python is interpreted**
> Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter, it means u don't need to compile the program before executing it.
* **Python is interactive**
>Python let you sit in the prompt and interact with the interpreter directly.
* **Python is Object-Oriented**
> Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.
* **Python is a Beginner's Language** 
> Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.

## **Foundation** 🌱

* Python is a **'interpreted language'**, which is a little bit different from **'compiled languages'** like C or Java.

- [ ] **[Using Python Interpreter](/Python/foundation/1_python_interpreter.md)**

    You can actually run Python code directly from command prompt.

* Python also uses the usual flow control statements known from other languages, with some twists.

* Most language  can be written (or more concise, ***formatted***) in different styles; some are more readable than others. Making it easy for others to read your code is always a good idea, and adopting a nice coding style helps tremendously for that.
