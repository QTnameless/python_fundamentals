# **Python** 🐍

> ### ***Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented and high-level programming language.***

### **Some advantages of learning Python** 👍

* **Python is interpreted**
> Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter, it means u don't need to compile the program before executing it.
* **Python is interactive**
>Python let you sit in the prompt and interact with the interpreter directly.
* **Python is Object-Oriented**
> Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.
* **Python is a Beginner's Language** 
> Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.

## **Foundation** 🌱

* Python is a **'interpreted language'**, which is a little bit different from **'compiled languages'** like C or Java.

    You can actually run Python code directly from command prompt.

* Python also uses the usual flow control statements known from other languages, with some twists.

* Most language  can be written (or more concise, ***formatted***) in different styles; some are more readable than others. Making it easy for others to read your code is always a good idea, and adopting a nice coding style helps tremendously for that.

### **More on Defining Functions**

*It is also possible to define functions with a variable number of arguments. There are three forms,which can be combined :*

    1. **Built-in Functions** : such as `help()` to ask for help, `min()` to get the minimum value, `print()` to print an object to the terminal,…  
    2. **User-Defined Functions (UDFs)** : functions that users create to help them out of their
    3. **Anonymous Functions (Lambda functions)** : not declared with the standard `def` keyword.
