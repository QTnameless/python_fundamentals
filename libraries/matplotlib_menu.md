## Introductory

> ***Cover the basics of creating visualizations with matplotlib, as well as some best practices in using the package effectively.***

* [**Basic Usage**](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/usage.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-introductory-usage-py) -- Covers some basic usage patterns

* [**Pyplot tutorial**](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-introductory-pyplot-py) -- Intro to Pyplot interface

    * `matplotlib.pyplot` is a collection of functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB.

* [**Image tutorial**](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/images.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-introductory-images-py) -- A short tutorial on plotting images with Matplotlib 

* [**The Lifecycle of a Plot**](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/lifecycle.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-introductory-lifecycle-py) -- Show the beginning, middle, and end of a single visualization using Matplotlib

    * begin with some ***raw data*** -> end by saving a ***figure of a customized visualization***.

    * Highlight some neat features and best practices using `matplotlib`. 

* [**Customizing Matplotlib with style sheets and rcParams**](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/customizing.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-introductory-customizing-py) -- Tips for customizing the properties and default styles of Matplotlib
    * Three ways to customize : **Setting rcParams at runtime**, **Using style sheets**, **Changing your matplotlibrc file** and **

## Intermediate

> ***Cover some of the more complicated classes and functions in Matplotli, which are useful for particular custom and complex visualizations.***

* [**Artist tutorial**](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/intermediate/artists.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-intermediate-artists-py) -- Using Artist objects to render on the canvas.

* [**Legend guide**](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/intermediate/legend_guide.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-intermediate-legend-guide-py) -- Generating legends flexibly in Matplotlib.

    * This guide is an extension of the documentation available at `legend()`
    
    * This guide makes use of some common terms :

        * ***legend entry*** - A legend is made up of one or more legend entries. An entry is made up of exactly one key and one label.
        
        * ***legend key*** - The colored/patterned marker to the left of each legend label.
        
        * ***legend label*** - The text which describes the handle represented by the key.
        
        * ***legend handle*** - The original object which is used to generate an appropriate entry in the legend.

* [**Styling with cycler**](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/intermediate/color_cycle.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-intermediate-color-cycle-py) -- Demo of custom property-cycle settings to control colors and other style properties for multi-line plots

* [**Constrained Layout Guide**](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/intermediate/constrainedlayout_guide.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-intermediate-constrainedlayout-guide-py) -- How to use constrained-layout to fit plots within your figure cleanly

* [**Tight Layout Guide**](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/intermediate/tight_layout_guide.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-intermediate-tight-layout-guide-py) -- How to use tight-layout to fit plots within your figure cleanly.

* [**Arranging multiple Axes in a Figure**](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/intermediate/arranging_axes.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-intermediate-arranging-axes-py)
    
    *  Often more than one Axes is wanted on a figure at a time, usually organized into a regular grid. Matplotlib has a variety of tools for working with grids of Axes. Here we will discuss the tools which users use most often, the tools that underpin how Axes are organized, and mention some of the older tools.

* [**Autoscaling**](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/intermediate/autoscale.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-intermediate-autoscale-py) -- The limits on an axis can be set manually or Matplotlib can set them automatically based on the data already on the axes. Here are some options.

* [**Origin and extent in `imshow`**](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/intermediate/imshow_extent.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-intermediate-imshow-extent-py) -- Allows users to render an image (either a 2D array which will be color-mapped (based on norm and cmap) or a 3D RGB(A) array which will be used as-is) to a rectangular region in data space.
