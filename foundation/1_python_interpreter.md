# 1. Using the Python Interpreter

## 1.1 Invoking the Interpreter

* The Python interpreter is usually installed as `/usr/local/bin/python<version>` on the machine where it is available.

ðŸ‘‰ **To launch python, use :**

```console
py
```

or
```console
python
```
ðŸ‘ˆ **To exit python**, use ***Ctrl + D*** (for Unix) or ***Ctrl + Z*** (for Windows) to exit without a exit status.

Or you can use this command for exiting interpreter :

```python
>>> quit()
```

* The interpreter operates when called with a file name argument or with a file with standard input can read and executes a script from that file
